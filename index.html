                <h2>The Must-Haves</h2>
                <p>When it comes to assembling a skills dream team, we first asked our experts: What do they covet most in new, developable talent? According to Kim Lupo, Walmart's senior vice president of global total rewards, it comes down to a mix of hard and soft skills, "as the skill set has evolved with the increasing importance of technology and data-driven decision-making." The hard skills on Lupo's list include having experience with (or even driving) TR strategies such as designing and managing compensation structures and benefit programs.</p>

                <p>Once those baseline considerations are filled, we then asked: What's the one skill our experts think will best position both the prospect and the TR team for immediate success? According to Justin Sun, a compensation expert with Expedia Group, it's the ability to speak the language of the business and articulate how compensation design can influence the company's overarching business strategy and success.</p>

Sun pointed to staying connected to external market practices and being keenly aware of evolving pay legislation as important elements for practitioner success. He cited the European Union Pay Transparency Directive as one example of how future TR pros will need to closely monitor what's occurring on a national and international level.</p>
